These libraries JSTC.JS allow you to make asynchronous calls to any service or api or rpc, c#, php, java etc...
And contains several functions for computer vision in javascript
storing the result also in an asynchronous variable.
Indeed a time capsule.
Ideal for use with jquery controls, or others,
It can be an alternative to Angular or for binding to ReactJS, SignalR etc.

This useful library of asynchronous functions for using variables in extemporaneous parallel streams. 
And 2 functions, one to convert text to binary: binaryToText(); and the second to convert the binary to text format: binaryToText().
It can be enriched

 bindJ(data, Type, url, contentType, dataType) passing Json text, data format, or data for control view interface like jquery UI

 bindJ3(data, Type, url) passing Json text, data format, or data for control view interface like jquery UI

 bindS(data, Type, url) passing String text, data format or data for control view interface like jquery UI

 bindX(data, Type, url) passing XML text, data format or data for control view interface like jquery UI

 bindB(data, Type, url) passing some text the function converts it into bits and does the binding, while the response in bits is converted into text

 bindH(data, Type, url) passing Html text, data format or data for control view interface like jquery UI

 binaryToText() to convert binary in text

 textToBinary() to convert text in binary

And this project implements too a comprehensive keypoint detection and matching algorithm for images using JavaScript and SQL.js, enabling client-side image analysis and pattern recognition within a web browser. The core components and functionalities of the project are as follows:

Input Parsing:

Parses user inputs for the gradient threshold and Gaussian kernel size, providing default values (gradientThreshold = 500, gaussSize = 5) if the inputs are empty or invalid.
Gaussian Kernel Creation (createGaussianKernel):

Generates a Gaussian kernel based on a specified size and standard deviation (sigma). This kernel is used for blurring the image to reduce noise and enhance feature detection.
Image Blurring (applyGaussianBlur):

Applies Gaussian blur to the image data using the generated Gaussian kernel. This step smooths the image and prepares it for gradient analysis by mitigating high-frequency noise.
Gradient Calculation (calculateGradientValue):

Calculates the gradient magnitude and orientation at each pixel using Sobel operators. The gradients are essential for detecting edges and features within the image.
Descriptor Calculation (calculateDescriptorMean):

Computes the mean value of descriptors around each pixel, which helps in characterizing the local image structure and is used for keypoint description.
Keypoint Detection:

Detection Functions (detectKeypoints, detectKeypointsFromImageData):
Identify keypoints in the image by analyzing the gradient magnitudes and orientations. A threshold is applied to filter out less significant points based on the gradient magnitude.
Stability Filtering (filterStableKeypoints):
Filters and retains stable keypoints by comparing detections across multiple scales using different Gaussian kernel sizes. Only keypoints consistent across these scales are considered stable and are kept.
Main Detection Algorithm (KeypointsDetectionAlgorithm):

Serves as the orchestrator function that ties together Gaussian blurring, gradient calculation, descriptor computation, and keypoint detection to produce a final set of stable keypoints.
Visualization (drawImageWithKeypoints):

Renders the original image onto a canvas element and overlays the detected keypoints. Each keypoint is highlighted (e.g., with circles or markers) to visualize where key features have been detected.
Database Integration:

Initialization (initializeDatabase):
Sets up an SQLite database in the browser using SQL.js, creating a table to store keypoint data with fields for gradient magnitude, orientation, and descriptor mean.
Data Insertion (insertKeypoints):
Inserts detected keypoints into the database, allowing for persistent storage and later retrieval or analysis.
Database Connection (connectToDatabase):
Manages the connection to the SQLite database, loading an existing database file if available or initializing a new one. It ensures the database schema is set up correctly.
Keypoint Matching:

Sorting (sortKeypoints):
Sorts keypoints based on gradient magnitude, orientation, and descriptor mean to facilitate efficient searching and matching.
Matching Function (matchTripleKey):
Matches query keypoints against those stored in the database or a sorted keypoint list. It uses specified tolerances for gradient magnitude, orientation, and descriptor mean to determine matches.
There are two implementations:
One that queries the SQLite database to find matching keypoints.
Another that operates on a sorted array of keypoints without database interaction.
Utility Functions:

Parsing Functions:
Ensure that inputs are correctly parsed and converted to appropriate data types, handling defaults and error cases gracefully.
Mathematical Operations:
Perform necessary calculations for Gaussian distribution, gradient computation, and descriptor analysis.
Overall Workflow:

The project takes an input image and processes it through several stages:
Pre-processing: Applies Gaussian blur to reduce noise.
Feature Detection: Calculates gradients and identifies keypoints based on specified thresholds.
Keypoint Filtering: Filters out unstable keypoints by cross-validating across multiple scales.
Data Storage: Stores the stable keypoints in an SQLite database for persistence.
Keypoint Matching: Allows for matching new query keypoints against the stored dataset, facilitating applications like image recognition or pattern matching.
Visualization: Provides a visual representation of detected keypoints on the image for analysis and verification.
Created By:

The project was developed by Giuseppe D'Ambrosio, as noted in the code comments.
Applications and Use Cases:

Computer Vision: The algorithm can be used for feature detection in computer vision tasks such as object recognition, tracking, and image stitching.
Image Recognition: By matching keypoints between images, the project can aid in recognizing similar images or detecting changes between them.
Educational Tool: Serves as an example of implementing image processing and feature detection algorithms using web technologies.
Technologies Used:

JavaScript: Core programming language for implementing the algorithms and logic.
Canvas API: Used for rendering images and drawing visualizations in the browser.
SQL.js: A JavaScript library that allows SQLite databases to be used within a web browser, enabling client-side data storage and querying without the need for server-side components.
Key Advantages:

Client-Side Processing: All computations are performed in the browser, which enhances privacy and reduces the need for server resources.
Portability: Being web-based, the project can run on any device with a modern browser without the need for additional installations.
Extensibility: The modular design allows for further enhancements, such as incorporating more advanced feature descriptors or integrating with other web applications.
Conclusion: This project delivers a robust framework for image keypoint detection and matching entirely within a web environment. By leveraging JavaScript and web technologies, it provides an accessible platform for experimenting with and deploying computer vision algorithms. The integration of an in-browser database for storing and matching keypoints adds to its versatility, making it suitable for various applications in image analysis and recognition.
